# symLinkPOC
A small gradle project to experiment with how GitHub handles symlinks

Although this is a gradle project and you can execute the task **runScript** inorder to see the symlink creation at work, you still have the option of running the **myscript.groovy** as plain groovy script and the symlink will be created for you.

This repo has has three branches : **main**, **valid_symlink** and **invalid_symlink**.

**main** branch contains starter project files.

**valid_symlink** branch contains valid symlink and corresponding code that generates it. 

**invalid_symlink** branch contains invalid symlink and corresponding code that generates it.
